# Stedding

Stedding is a minimalistic LEMP Stack setup for Laravel PHP. It facilitates the setting up of Laravel apps on a well prepared Ubuntu based VPS using Ansible Playbooks.

## Quick Setup

To get started, you will need:

- **Ansible Control Node**: A machine with Ansible installed and configured to connect to your Ansible hosts using SSH keys.
- **Ansible Hosts**: One or more remote Ubuntu 22.04 servers. Ensure that each host has the control nodeâ€™s public key added to its `authorized_keys` file for SSH access.

**NB** For hashing the password for the admin user you have to install passlib:

```bash
pip install passlib
```

### Steps:

1. **Install Ansible**: Ensure Ansible is installed on your control node. You can follow this [Ansible installation guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-ubuntu-18-04).

2. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/stedding.git
   cd stedding
   ```

3. **Set up your inventory file**: Use `inventory-example` as a base for creating your own `inventory` file.

4. **Adjust configuration**: Modify the values in your `group_vars/all.yml` file according to your environment.

5. **Run the server setup playbook**: Execute the `server-setup.yml` playbook to set up the LEMP server:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook server-setup.yml
   ```

6. **Deploy Laravel**: Run the `laravel-deploy.yml` playbook to deploy the demo Laravel application:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook laravel-deploy.yml
   ```

7. **Access the Application**: Use your server's IP address or hostname to verify the setup.

## Local Testing with Docker

You can use Docker to create an isolated environment for running your Ansible playbooks locally.

### Steps to Set Up:

1. **Install Docker**: Follow the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

2. **Build and Run the Docker Container**:

    Update `SSH_KEY_URL` with your Github url for ssh public keys. Then run the command to build the image
   ```bash
   docker build -t ansible-test-host .
   ```
3. Run the Docker Container: After building the image, start the container:

    ```bash
    docker run --privileged  -d --name ansible-test-host -p 2222:22 ansible-test-host
    ```
   This will run the container in detached mode and bind the container's SSH service to port 2222 on your local machine.
   
   **NB** The `--privileged` flag grants the container extended privileges, allowing it to modify networking settings like UFW and iptables.

4.  SSH into the Container (Optional): 
You can now SSH into the container using the testuser account to verify that everything is working:

    ```bash
    ssh testuser@localhost -p 2222
    ```
    You can then check Ubuntu version
    ```bash
    sudo su
    root@70e2eb742cab:/home/testuser# cd /etc/os-release
    bash: cd: /etc/os-release: Not a directory
    root@70e2eb742cab:/home/testuser# cat /etc/os-release
    PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 24.04 LTS"
    ...
    UBUNTU_CODENAME=noble
    LOGO=ubuntu-logo
    ```

## Notes

This is the new version of Stedding, based on [Heidi's Ansible Laravel Demo](https://github.com/do-community/ansible-laravel-demo).
