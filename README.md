# Stedding

New version of Stedding based on [Heidi's Ansible Laravel Demo](https://github.com/do-community/ansible-laravel-demo).

## Quick Setup

TL;DR:

Make sure you have [Ansible installed](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-ubuntu-18-04) on your control node, which can be your local machine or a remote server dedicated to running Ansible.
You'll need one Ubuntu 18.04 server to serve as node / host.

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up your inventory file - you can use `inventory-example` as base
3. Adjust values on your `group_vars/all.yml` file
4. Run the `server-setup.yml` playbook to set up the LEMP server
5. Run the `laravel-deploy.yml` playbook to deploy the demo Laravel application
6. Access your server's IP address or hostname to test the setup

**NB** This repository is based of the [Automating Server Setup - a DigitalOcean Workshop Kit](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/meetup_kits/automating-server-setup-with-ansible-a-digitalocean-workshop-kit).
